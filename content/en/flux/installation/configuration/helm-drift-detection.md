### Enable Helm drift detection

At present, Helm releases are not by default checked for drift compared to
cluster-state. To enable experimental drift detection, you must add the
`--feature-gates=DetectDrift=true` flag to the helm-controller Deployment.

Enabling it will cause the controller to check for drift on all Helm releases
using a dry-run Server Side Apply, triggering an upgrade if a change is detected.
For detailed information about this feature, [refer to the
documentation](/flux/components/helm/).
