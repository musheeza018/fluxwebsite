Flux is an architectural pattern designed for building user interfaces, specifically in the context of web applications. It was initially introduced by Facebook as a means to manage state in complex and data-driven applications. Flux emphasizes a unidirectional flow of data, providing a clear structure to handle application state and data flow.

Flux consists of several distinct components that work together to create a smooth and manageable data flow within an application.

## Prerequisites

You will need a Kubernetes cluster that matches one of the following versions:

| Kubernetes version | Minimum required |
|--------------------|------------------|
| `v1.24`            | `>= 1.24.0`      |
| `v1.25`            | `>= 1.25.0`      |
| `v1.26`            | `>= 1.26.0`      |
| `v1.27` and later  | `>= 1.27.1`      |

{{% alert color="info" title="Kubernetes EOL" %}}
Note that Flux may work on older versions of Kubernetes e.g. 1.19,
but we don't recommend running [EOL versions](https://endoflife.date/kubernetes)
in production nor do we offer support for these versions.

{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabpane >}}

To configure your shell to load `flux` [bash completions](./cmd/flux_completion_bash.md) add to your profile:

```sh
. <(flux completion bash)
```

[`zsh`](./cmd/flux_completion_zsh.md), [`fish`](./cmd/flux_completion_fish.md),
and [`powershell`](./cmd/flux_completion_powershell.md)
are also supported with their own sub-commands.

A container image with `kubectl` and `flux` is available on DockerHub and GitHub:

* `docker.io/fluxcd/flux-cli:<version>`
* `ghcr.io/fluxcd/flux-cli:<version>`

## Bootstrap with Flux CLI

Using the `flux bootstrap` command you can install Flux on a
Kubernetes cluster and configure it to manage itself from a Git
repository.

If the Flux components are present on the cluster, the bootstrap
command will perform an upgrade if needed. The bootstrap is
idempotent, it's safe to run the command as many times as you want.

The Flux component images are published to DockerHub and GitHub Container Registry
as [multi-arch container images](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/multi-arch/)
with support for Linux `amd64`, `arm64` and `armv7` (e.g. 32bit Raspberry Pi)
architectures.

If your Git provider is **AWS CodeCommit**, **Azure DevOps**, **Bitbucket Server**, **GitHub** or **GitLab** please
follow the specific bootstrap procedure:

* [Generic Git Server](./bootstrap/generic-git-server.md)
* [AWS CodeCommit](./bootstrap/aws-codecommit.md#flux-installation-for-aws-codecommit)
* [Azure DevOps](./bootstrap/azure.md#flux-installation-for-azure-devops)
* [Bitbucket Server and Data Center](./bootstrap/bitbucket.md#bitbucket-server-and-data-center)
* [GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise](./bootstrap/github.md#github-and-github-enterprise)
* [GitLab.com and GitLab Enterprise](./bootstrap/gitlab.md#gitlab-and-gitlab-enterprise)

## Bootstrap with Terraform

The bootstrap procedure can be implemented with Terraform using the Flux provider published on
[registry.terraform.io](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/fluxcd/flux).
The provider offers a Terraform resource called
[flux_bootstrap_git](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/fluxcd/flux/latest/docs/resources/bootstrap_git)
that can be used to bootstrap Flux in the same way the Flux CLI does it.

Example of Git HTTPS bootstrap:

```hcl
provider "flux" {
  kubernetes = {
    config_path = "~/.kube/config"
  }
  git = {
    url  = var.gitlab_url
    http = {
      username = var.gitlab_user
      password = var.gitlab_token
    }
  }
}

resource "flux_bootstrap_git" "this" {
  path                   = "clusters/my-cluster"
  network_policy         = true
  kustomization_override = file("${path.module}/kustomization.yaml")
}
```

For more details on how to use the Terraform provider
please see the [Flux docs on registry.terraform.io](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/fluxcd/flux/latest/docs).

## Customize Flux manifests

You can customize the Flux components before or after running bootstrap.

Assuming you want to customise the Flux controllers before they get deployed on the cluster,
first you'll need to create a Git repository and clone it locally.

Create the file structure required by bootstrap with:

```sh
mkdir -p clusters/my-cluster/flux-system
touch clusters/my-cluster/flux-system/gotk-components.yaml \
    clusters/my-cluster/flux-system/gotk-sync.yaml \
    clusters/my-cluster/flux-system/kustomization.yaml
```

Add patches to `kustomization.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1
kind: Kustomization
resources: # manifests generated during bootstrap
  - gotk-components.yaml
  - gotk-sync.yaml

patches: # customize the manifests during bootstrap
  - target:
      kind: Deployment
      labelSelector: app.kubernetes.io/part-of=flux
    patch: |
      # strategic merge or JSON patch
```

Push the changes to main branch:

```sh
git add -A && git commit -m "init flux" && git push
```

And run the bootstrap for `clusters/my-cluster`:

```sh
flux bootstrap git \
  --url=ssh://git@<host>/<org>/<repository> \
  --branch=main \
  --path=clusters/my-cluster
```

To make further amendments, pull the changes locally,
edit the `kustomization.yaml` file, push the changes upstream
and rerun bootstrap or let Flux upgrade itself.

Checkout the [bootstrap cheatsheet](../cheatsheets/bootstrap) for various examples of how to customize Flux.

## Dev install

For testing purposes you can install Flux without storing its manifests in a Git repository:

```sh
flux install
```

Or using kubectl:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/releases/latest/download/install.yaml
```

Then you can register Git repositories and reconcile them on your cluster:

```sh
flux create source git podinfo \
  --url=https://github.com/stefanprodan/podinfo \
  --tag-semver=">=4.0.0" \
  --interval=1m

flux create kustomization podinfo-default \
  --source=podinfo \
  --path="./kustomize" \
  --prune=true \
  --validation=client \
  --interval=10m \
  --health-check="Deployment/podinfo.default" \
  --health-check-timeout=2m \
  --target-namespace=default
```

You can register Helm repositories and create Helm releases:

```sh
flux create source helm bitnami \
  --interval=1h \
  --url=https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami

flux create helmrelease nginx \
  --interval=1h \
  --release-name=nginx-ingress-controller \
  --target-namespace=kube-system \
  --source=HelmRepository/bitnami \
  --chart=nginx-ingress-controller \
  --chart-version="5.x.x"
```
